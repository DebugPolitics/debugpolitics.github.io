##Debug Politics

Welcome to Debug Politics, a project dedicated to harnessing the talents of the tech community to help bring about political change. We host a series of hackathons oriented around discussing and launching new ideas. This is an open source project, so feel free to make a pull request. Just like our political system, this site needs input from many voices to succeed.
